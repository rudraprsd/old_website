                    at the <span class="yellow">Indian
                        Institute of Science Education and Research, Berhampur.</span> I'm a second-year student who's
                    all
                    about physics
                    and computer science. That's right, I'm planning to major in <span class="yellow">physics</span> and
                    minor
                    in <span class="yellow">computer science.</span>
                    Here are some of my favorite <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZXUrwpQJ_mjIHHVkjW38BVOd_-1UvwcODFOMWxdi-0M/edit?usp=sharing" class="link" target="_blank">books on physics</a>, for anyone who is interested in learning more about this fascinating subject.
                    <!-- I'm also proud to have done some <a href="#">research and publications</a> - wanna check them out?  -->

            <div class="new">
                <p>But let me tell you what really gets me going:
                    <span class="yellow">quantum physics</span> (till now). That stuff
                    is out of this world, literally. I'm
                    super interested in exploring how it can be applied in the fields of physics and computer science,
                    especially
                    when it comes to <span class="yellow">quantum computing.</span> 
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="new">
                <p>When I'm not geeking out over physics, you can probably find me messing around with artificial
                    intelligence and
                    machine learning. I've done a bunch of projects using Python, MATLAB, and C++. Don't worry if you
                    don't
                    know
                    what those are, just know that I'm a
                    <span class="yellow">boss</span>&#128526; at them.

            <div class="new">
                <p>Oh, and did I mention that I'm also a
                    <span class="yellow">website whiz</span> ? That's right, I've designed a
                    few websites in my spare time.
                    No biggie.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="new">
                <p>When I'm not on the computer, I'm all about that two-wheel life. That's right, I love <span
                        class="yellow">riding</span> my bike around town.
                    It's just me, the wind in my hair, and the open road.</p>

            <div class="new">
                <p>And let's not forget about my
                    <span class="yellow">photography</span> skills. I love capturing candid moments,
                    even though I don't have a
                    fancy camera yet. But mark my words, I'll have one soon enough. &#128516;

            <div class="new">
                <p>So there you have it, folks. I'm a highly motivated and organized student who's always looking to
                    push
                    boundaries
                    and learn more. And when I'm not busy being a physics/computer science prodigy, you can probably
                    catch
                    me
                    snoozing away in my cozy bed. Hey, <span class="yellow">a guy's gotta rest up if he's gonna change
